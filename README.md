# Test 2 Express js and Squelize

## Description:

This is a test.

The test is to save each ten minutes the information that comes from a web json API into a database without repeating it and offer the results as a web json API reading it from this database.

## Development:

The first thing I did was to create an Expres js project.

Since I do not knew about Squelize, I started to look for information about it.
